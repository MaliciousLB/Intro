This includes attempting to change the phase to a different one activating and resolving card effects Battle Phase interactions & more! You may ask: “Why would I need my opponent’s permission to play MY card?” And the answer to this is simple they may have a response to your action whether it may be to negate the activation of the card or the effect or to simply respond with a quick or fast effect of their own. This is explained more in-depth in the “Communication” guide in the “Freshman Courses”. There can only be one 1 st place prize winner & that may upset some Duelists. While it’s natural to feel displeased in the face of defeat a Duelist who humbles themselves & takes the time to speak with their opponent after the match – seeking advice on how to improve in the next encounter as well as sharing personal mistakes committed during the match can only improve as a result of such conversation. Becoming too displeased will prevent self-growth for both players & can potentially negatively affect future matches in the event.
