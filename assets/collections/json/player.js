This includes attempting to change the phase to a different one activating and resolving card effects Battle Phase interactions & more! You may ask: “Why would I need my opponent’s permission to play MY card?” And the answer to this is simple they may have a response to your action whether it may be to negate the activation of the card or the effect or to simply respond with a quick or fast effect of their own. This is explained more in-depth in the “Communication” guide in the “Freshman Courses”. There can only be one 1 st place prize winner & that may upset some Duelists. While it’s natural to feel displeased in the face of defeat a Duelist who humbles themselves & takes the time to speak with their opponent after the match – seeking advice on how to improve in the next encounter as well as sharing personal mistakes committed during the match can only improve as a result of such conversation. Becoming too displeased will prevent self-growth for both players & can potentially negatively affect future matches in the event. A hand- shake or gesture of respect before and after the match is proof of a Duelist’s maturity & growth within the community. “Yu-Jo Friendship” [Shonen Jump Sub Bonus] May 2006 - “Mokey Mokey Smackdown” [Rise of Destiny] December 2004 ","showCover":true},"12":{"id":12,"type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"dd123b16687304aa296dc0i133288976","page":10},"width":816,"height":1056,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[],"bgColor":"","products":[],"extractedText":"Each Duelist is responsible for properly communicating their activity & intent at all times during a match.
